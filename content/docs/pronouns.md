It is helpful to note that there are two forms of the second person pronouns. The appropriate
one to be used depends on whether it is a singular second person being referred to or multiple.
The main third person pronouns in pidgin are non-gendered. The gendered pronouns can be
used in subjective positions, but not in objective positions.

## Subjective Pronouns
Subjective pronouns are used when the person being referred to is the doer of an action.

Below is a description of the equivalent subjective pronouns in pidgin
- I: I
- You (singular): You
- You (plural): Una
- He / She: E
- We: We
- They: They

The main third person pronouns in pidgin are non-gendered. The gendered pronouns can be
used in subjective positions, but not in objective positions. This means that you can use
he and she in pidgin. 

While you can technically use "he" in pidgin, it sounds slightly out of place. You would want to particularly prefer "E" over "he."

### Sample uses of subjective pronouns
- I tell Bolu. (I told Bolu.)
- You don try. (You have tried.)
- Una don reach? (Have you arrived?)
- E never chop. (He/she has not eaten.)
- She pass the exam. (She passed the exam.)
- We wan comot. (We want to leave.)
- They sabi the song. (They know the song)

## Objective Pronouns
Objective pronouns are used when the person being refered to is the "receiver" of an action.

Below is a description of the equivalent subjective pronouns in pidgin
- Me: Me
- You (singular): You
- You (plural): Una
- Him / Her: Am
- Us: Us
- Them: Dem

While you can use he/she in pidgin, "him" and "her" usually sound out of place in pidgin.

## Sample uses of objective pronouns
- My friend drop me for junction. (My friend dropped me off at the junction.)
- Ada go show you the place. (Ada will show you the place.)
- I wan give una the food. (I want to give you the food.)
- No tell am. (Don't tell him/her)
- They teach us for school. (They taught us at school.)
- Nobody don see them since last week. (Nobody has seen them since last week.)
